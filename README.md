This is an Eclipse project. The main() method is in the Simulation class.
There is a document called comparion.txt in the root folder, which compares the default / optimised algorithms.
Javadocs are in the /doc folder.

Had some weird bugs with the Streams classes, but upgraded to Java 1.8.25 and seems to be ok now.

Never heard back from Mayra :(  Emailed Oded on 15/12/2014 to ask what to do but never got a reply from him either!  So just cracked on and finished myself.
